# Pipe Loss App

This is a Python App built with Kivy Library which computes the head loss of a fluid moving along a pipe system taking into account Major and minor losses. 



## ðŸ”° How does it work?

This app is built using Kivy builder settings. It has several windows where an user could input the data to compute the head losses of a fluid into a pipe system with accesories.

## Main Window

There are 3 windows where an user could input the data:
* Fluid Properties
* Pipe Characteristics
* Accesories

And there is a button to compute the head loss.



## Fluid Properties

In this window an user must input the flow rate in $\frac{m^3}{s}$, and select the fluid in order to load its density $(\frac{kg}{m^3})$ and dynamic viscosity $(Pa-s)$. By default, an user could select any of the following fluids:
* Water
* Air
* Glycerine
* Oil
* Gasoline

But there is an *Other* option which open another window where the user could input data such as:
* Name of the fluid
* Density
* Dynamic Viscosity
